Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

Reflecting on this assignment, I realized several key takeaways and areas for improvement. First, I deepened my understanding of data manipulation and user interfaces using pandas and Streamlit. By building helper functions like get_column_names and get_unique_values, I became more comfortable navigating pandas' capabilities for filtering and exploring datasets. I practiced working with different file types (CSV, Excel, and JSON), learning how to efficiently load them using pandas. The key lesson was that handling various formats requires an understanding of their structure and the appropriate function (like pd.read_csv for CSVs and pd.read_json for JSONs). One area of confusion for me was matching column data types in pandas to NumPy types, such as object, int64, float64. While the functions work,I could use more clarity in understanding why pandas uses certain types over others and how this impacts operations. Furthermore, I need more practice with Streamlit, especially understanding how to create more dynamic dashboards with features like toggles, checkboxes, and user inputs. Diving deeper into Streamlitâ€™s documentation would help me make more complex applications.
